        <h2>Question</h2>
        <p>An integer number greater than 1 is called a ​prime​ if it cannot be divided without a remainder by anything except 1 and itself. 
            <br>
        In other words, n > 1 is a prime if it can’t be evenly divided by anything except 1 and n. 
        <br>
        For example, 5 is a prime, because it cannot be divided without a remainder by 2, 3 and 4. 
        <br>
        <b>Write the code which outputs prime numbers in the interval from 2 to n.</b>
        <br>
        For n = 10 the result will be 2,3,5,7.
        <br>
        P.S. The code should work for any n, not be hard-tuned for any fixed value
        </p>
        <p>To get output open console.</p>
        <script>
           var limit = prompt("Enter the value of  N -");
           for(let i=2;i<=limit;i++)
           {
               let isPrime = true;
               for(let j=2;j<i;j++)
               {
                   if(i%j == 0)
                   {
                       isPrime = false;
                       break;
                   }
               }
               if(isPrime)
               {
                   console.log(i);
